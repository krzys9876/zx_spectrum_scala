ZX Spectrum ROM is copyright of Amstrad plc. According to: [this message](https://worldofspectrum.net/app/themes/wosc-classic/static/legacy/amstrad-roms.txt) it can be freely used for emulators and personal use. 

The ROM disassembly was published in 1983 in [The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/2000076/Book/The_Complete_Spectrum_ROM_Disassembly) so I believe it can be used 
for personal use as well.

Knight Lore is copyright of Ultimate Play the Game (see: [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Lore)). It is downloadable from number of places in a form of a TAP file or as a source, but
I do not include it here.
